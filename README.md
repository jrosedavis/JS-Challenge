## Instructions:

### Level 1: Automatic Table and Date Search (Required)

* Create a basic HTML web page and using the UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, write code that appends a table to your web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.
  * Make sure you have a column for `date/time`, `city`, `state`, `country`, `shape`, and `comment` at the very least.
* Use a date form in your HTML document and write JavaScript code that will listen for events and search through the `date/time` column to find rows that match user input.

### Level 2: Multiple Search Categories (Optional)
* Using multiple `input` tags and/or select dropdowns, write JavaScript code so the user can to set multiple filters and search for UFO sightings using the following criteria based on the table columns:
  * `date/time`
  * `city`
  * `state`
  * `country`
  * `shape`
